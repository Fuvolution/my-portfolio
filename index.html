            <a href="https://lildano50.github.io/group-project-1/"> This is the link to the deployed application for my first group project!</a>
            <h3> Description: </h3>
            <p> For our first group project, we developed a website named What to Do that takes in the zip code entered and use Local Events Rapid API to search for local events </p>
            <p> near that zip code! Then, the user can choose to save that event into a My To Do List whenever the user wants to keep track of which event to pay attention to. </p>
            <p> Even if the user doesn't find any event generated interesting, the user has the option to reclick the "Tell me what to do" button to generate a new list of events </p>
            <p> to choose! </p>
